## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Smart-Safety-Ring is a compact, intelligent wearable device engineered to enhance personal safety in real-world environments. Designed for high-risk scenarios such as walking alone, traveling at night, or living in vulnerable areas, this ring silently bridges technology with security.

At its core, the ring offers emergency assistance through discreet but powerful features. With just a press or gesture, it can activate a loud SOS siren, send emergency texts to trusted contacts, trigger a fake call to defuse threatening situations, or share live location updates‚Äîeven without active network connectivity, thanks to smart Bluetooth integration.

The ring is paired with a multilingual mobile app that enables full customization of features such as geofencing zones, emergency contacts, and alert platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Additional innovations like fall detection, safety timers, gesture recognition, and panic mode elevate the device to a full-scale safety ecosystem.

This isn‚Äôt just a gadget‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline, thoughtfully designed for women, children, the elderly, and anyone seeking proactive personal security in unpredictable environments.
